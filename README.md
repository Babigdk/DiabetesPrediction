# Diabetes Prediction Dataset README

## About the Dataset

This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its primary objective is to predict diagnostically whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements provided in the dataset. The selection of instances for this dataset involved several constraints. Notably, all patients included are females of at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage.

## Column Description for Diabetes Data

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Pregnancies**
- **Glucose**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Skin Thickness**
- **Insulin**
- **BMI**
- **Diabetes**
- **Age**
- **Outcome**

## Dataset Analysis Steps

### Step 1:

1. Download and open the dataset to understand the expected analysis.
2. Recognize that the dataset is suitable for predictive analysis, which involves understanding probable future trends and behaviors.
3. Partition the data into independent and dependent variables. All variables except 'Outcome' are independent, with 'Outcome' serving as the dependent variable.
4. In the dataset, '0' represents a non-diabetic person, while '1' indicates a diabetic person.

### Step 2:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook.
2. Import necessary packages.
3. Ensure required packages are installed in Jupyter Notebook using the following commands:
   - `pip install numpy`
   - `pip install pandas`
   - `pip install scikit-learn`
   - `pip install matplotlib`
   - `pip install seaborn`

### Step 3:

#### a) Importing Required Libraries

- **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation using DataFrames and Series.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing, supporting large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, with high-level mathematical functions.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization, creating attractive and informative graphics based on Matplotlib.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive plotting library providing an interface for creating various plots like line, scatter, bar, and histograms.

#### b) Importing Important Libraries for Prediction

- **Train Test Split**: Technique for splitting data into training and testing sets to assess model performance.
- **Logistic Regression**: Method for predicting the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic function.
- **Accuracy**: Metric measuring the proportion of correctly classified instances in a classification model.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: Python's powerful machine learning library providing tools for data analysis and model building.

#### c) Loading the Dataset

- Obtain the path of the file and paste it into the `data = pd.read_csv("paste here")` command.

#### d) Checking for Missing Values

- Output will display any missing values in the dataset.

#### e) Correlation Matrix Visualization

- Visualize the correlation between variables in the dataset.
